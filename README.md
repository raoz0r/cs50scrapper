# 📚 CS50Scrapper — Extracting and Structuring CS50 Content into JSON

**CS50Scrapper** is a Python-based command-line utility that scrapes hierarchical content from Harvard's CS50 course pages and outputs it as structured JSON. It’s built to simplify content indexing, archiving, or repurposing by turning the website’s nested data into a clean, machine-readable format.

## Key Features

* **HTML Scraping**: Parses deeply nested course content using BeautifulSoup.
* **JSON Structuring**: Converts extracted data into a clean, well-organized hierarchy.
* **URL Sanitization**: Removes query strings and fragments to normalize links.
* **Resilient Requests**: Includes retry mechanisms to handle network hiccups.
* **CLI Workflow**: Run it straight from your terminal with one simple command.

## How to Use

Run the script with a CS50 course URL:

```bash
python -m cs50scrapper.cli <CS50_course_url>
```

### Arguments

* `<CS50_course_url>`: The URL of the CS50 course page you want to scrape.

This will generate a `.json` file inside a folder like `cs50/python/`, named according to the page’s title or structure.
